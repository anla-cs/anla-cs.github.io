**About me**

I'm An La, a PhD student at [UMass Amherst/Theory Group](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/theory/). I'm working with [Dr. Hung Le](https://www.cics.umass.edu/about/directory/hung-le) mainly on computational geometry. I'm also interested in online algorithms with Machine Learning advice. 
<!-- I'm curious in models and algorithms for Data Science, such as randomized/streaming/sketching algorithms, mechanism design in game theory, probabilistic models. -->
